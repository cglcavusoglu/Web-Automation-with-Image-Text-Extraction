# Web-Automation-with-Image-Text-Extraction

This Python script demonstrates web automation using Selenium and image text extraction using pytesseract. It automates the process of filling in form fields on a web page, including a verification code, by capturing a screenshot, extracting the text from the image using optical character recognition (OCR), and entering the extracted text into the corresponding input field. The script utilizes the Chrome WebDriver and interacts with the web page elements using XPath.

The code is useful for scenarios where automated interaction with web forms and handling image-based verification codes is required. It showcases how to leverage popular libraries to automate repetitive tasks and extract useful information from images.
